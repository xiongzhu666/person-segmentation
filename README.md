# person-segmentation

I traind a small person segmentation model by u-2-net. the size of the fp16 model is only about 2Mb and it is friendly deployment for Android or ARM platform. the repo is just for demo and the precision is not very good.

I write a simple code interenced by ncnn or onnxruntime

c++ dependency： opencv ncnn

python dependcy：onnxruntime
